This is the Random Vehicle Data Generator.
We've deviced a cool (not so) random vehicle data generator for you to use as a base. It basically read out `.json` data that is located on `/meta` and broadcast out each row in `nats`.

In case you're wondering what `nats` is, It is a really hot new sofware that we use to do message broadcasting in a pub-sub model. In essence it allows you to send data to everybody thats interested. 

Happy Coding!
